It is beyond me why Windows batch files don't have a built in sleep command.

I know it is a part of the Windows Resource Kit, but when installing extra pack is not an option, you can always resort <a href="http://malektips.com/dos0017.html">to using ping</a> as a poor man's substitute for sleep.

For example this command will effectively sleep for 15 seconds:
<pre lang="dos">ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 15000 > NUL</pre>
