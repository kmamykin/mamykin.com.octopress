h2. Updating Gemfile

code. 
> bundle update rails
Bundler could not find find gem activesupport (= 3.1.0.rc3, runtime),which is required by gem multi_json (~> 1.0, runtime).

code. 
> bundle install
Fetching source index for http://rubygems.org/
You have requested:
  rails ~> 3.1.0.rc4

The bundle currently has rails locked at 3.0.9.
Try running `bundle update rails`

The approach I took is to comment out all my gems in Gemfile except
those that are dependency of rails 3.1, update rails, and then uncomment
gems one by one and deal with errors.

For example, in my case linkedin gem was found to cause the problem
depending on earlier versions of multi_json, where as rails 3.1 requires as a minimum
1.0.2.

Another approach is to rename the gemset (you are using rvm, aren't
you?) to something else for reference and create an empty gemset with
the original name. Then try to install the updated Gemfile with bundle
install. (Note, you may need to remove Gemfile.lock before this)

Running bundle install on a recreated gemset seems to be the cleaner
approach, and that is the one I used.

h3. Errors and Solutions

undefined method `debug_rjs=' for ActionView::Base:Class

This option was "removed in rails":https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/d8f23ca627df85b33fe8db87db5483c10b62bfe6
You will need to remove a reference to it from config/environments/development.rb
