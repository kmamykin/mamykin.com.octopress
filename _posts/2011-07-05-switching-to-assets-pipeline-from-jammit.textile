title: Migrating from Jammit to Asset Pipeline in Rails 3.1
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

*Update: 2011/08/04* - with the release of rails 3.1.0.rc5 the deployment story solidified, and heroku guys published "a blog post how to deploy 3.1 asset pipeline.":http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails31_heroku_cedar.

h2. TLDR version:
* "WTF is sprockets? I love my jammit setup!". You can still upgrade to rails 3.1, disable asset pipeline with @config.assets.enabled=false@ and jammit will be happy.
* Asset fingerprinting *really* simplifies deployment to CDNs, specifically Amazon's CloudFront. 
* Heroku.com now supports compiling assets on the fly, but *requires Cedar stack*. Stack migration is not to be taken lightly.
* Things are still in flux, some gem version combinations are incompatible, etc etc, but you knew that didn't you? Here is a "gist of the important files":http://gist.github.com/1124723

h2. Overview

In my "previous post":/2011/07/03/upgrading-to-rails31-rc4.html I described the steps necessary to upgrade an existing application to Rails 3.1, but the post did not go into details about how to migrate an existing collection of assets (in my case packaged using Jammit/Jammit-S3 gems) to Sprockets based asset pipeline. Here we dive into the nitty gritty of the migration.


h2. Migration approach

# Making sprockets asset pipeline work in parallel with Jammit
# Shifting some weight to sprockets (make it serve jquery for example)
# Adding compass and compass extensions
# Migrating the rest of the assets
# Deploying to Heroku, S3, CloudFront
# Final cleanup


h2. A primer to asset pipeline configuration

Rails exposes app.config.assets hash during Rails initialization process. 
You can modify the values of the config hash inside your config/application.rb or config/environments/xxx.rb.
Here is the "definition of the assets config hash with the defaults":https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/application/configuration.rb

* *config.assets.enabled* - disables the whole processing of assets. Meaning all you assets should reside and sill be served from Rails.public_path.
* *config.assets.path* - is an array of paths populated at Rails initialization process with directories where assets are looked up. By default this is app/assets, lib/assets, vendor/assets plus collection of directories from gems that expose assets.
* *config.assets.precompile* - an array of filename patterns that will be precompiled when running @rake assets:precompile@. If you have more then one package of js or css (e.g. application.css and mobile.css), you should @config.assets.precompile += %w( mobile.css )@ in your config/application.rb
* *config.prefix* - the path Sprockets asset pipeline will mount on to serve compiled assets.

h2. Making Sprockets asset pipeline work in parallel with Jammit

# Remove Jammit pre-generated asset files: @rm -rf public/assets@. If there are pre-generated files in /assets rails will serve those without processing your app/assets folder.
# Make Jammit mount on some other path by adding @package_path: jammit@ to config/assets.yml
# Enable asset pipeline with @config.assets.enabled = true@ inside config/application.rb
# Copy over app/assets folder from a newly generated rails app to your app. I also renamed application.css to application.css.scss
# Include new stylesheet and javascript tags to your layout with @= stylesheet_link_tag 'application'@ and @= javascript_include_tag 'application'@, before corresponding Jammit calls to @= include_stylesheets :application@ and @= include_javascripts :application@
# Move images from public/images to app/assets/images. Note that the paths hardcoded in stylesheets may be broken (we will fix it later)
# Restart server, most of the site should be functioning. Watch the server console output for the assets with broken links

h2. Shifting some weight to sprockets

Here we make asset pipeline serve jquery, jquery_ujs and jquery-ui javascript files that are bundled in jquery-rails gem.

# Make sure your app/assets/javascripts/application.js has 
{% highlight javascript %}
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require jquery-ui
{% endhighlight %}
# Remove bundling of jquery.js, jquery-ui.js and rails.js (replaced by jquery_ujs.js) from config/assets.yml. If you did not bundle jquery with Jammit and used a CDN to serve it, remove it from your layout markup.

h2. Adding compass and compass extensions

You need to use compass gem from github for now

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'compass', :git => 'https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass.git', :branch => 'rails31'
gem 'sass',  '3.1.5' # I had to fix this version due to a weird interaction b/w compass's blueprint and sass
{% endhighlight %}

Inside config/application.rb:

{% highlight ruby %}
config.sass.load_paths << "#{Gem.loaded_specs['compass'].full_gem_path}/frameworks/compass/stylesheets"
config.sass.load_paths << "#{Gem.loaded_specs['compass'].full_gem_path}/frameworks/blueprint/stylesheets"
{% endhighlight %}

I also deleted config/compass.rb, as it does not appear to be doing anything (was only used for compass cli?)

To test, add @@import "blueprint/reset";@ into app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss, restart the server and inspect the content of /assets/application.css


h2. Migrating the rest of the assets

h3. Asset helpers

sass-rails gem defines new helpers to use *inside scss templates*:
  * `asset_path($relative-asset-path, $asset-class)` - Returns a string to the asset.
    For example: `asset_path("rails.png", image)` becomes `"/assets/rails.png"`
  * `asset_url($relative-asset-path, $asset-class)` - Returns url reference to the asset.
    For example: `asset_url("rails.png", image)` becomes `url(/assets/rails.png)`
  * As a convenience, for each of the following asset classes there are
    corresponding `_path` and `_url` helpers:
    image, font, video, audio, javascript, stylesheet.
    For example: `image_url("rails.png")` becomes `url(/assets/rails.png)` and
    `image_path("rails.png")` becomes `"/assets/rails.png"`.

{% highlight css %}
body {
  some-path: asset-path("rails.png", image);
  some-url: asset-url("rails.png", image);
}
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Other gotchas and tips

By default Sprockets will concatenate all your javascripts into one /assets/application.js event in development environment. This may not be ideal if you have lots of files and need debugging. Adding :debug => true to the calls to include_javascript solves the issue:
@= javascript_include_tag 'application', :debug => Rails.env.development?@

If you are using Sass's @@import "somepartial";@ in your application.css.scss, the partial file should be named @_somepartial.css.scss@ (.css.scss ending is important), otherwise variables defined in that partial will not be visible outside of that partial, and you will get @Sass::SyntaxError: Undefined variable: "$xxx"@.

jQuery UI images are referenced from jQuery UI stylesheet as a relative url('images/image-xxx.png'), and this link gets broken because the final stylesheet that gets served to the browser is /assets/application.css. Instead of modifying jquery ui css, I moved the images under app/assets/images/images (should be vendor/assets/images/images??). This allows for a drop-in jquery-ui styles replacement without modifying all internal references to images.

If you are using Mongoid, you may notice that rendering a page takes forever, every image request takes a while. Apparently this is due to Mongoid preloading all models (and hittng mongod) for every request, even for an image. Adding 
@config.mongoid.preload_models = false@
in your config/environments/development.rb makes your migration much much faster. ("Beware if you are using single collection inheritance":http://mongoid.org/docs/rails/railties.html)

h2. Deploying to Heroku with CloudFront CDN

Running Rails asset pipeline in development mode will recompile css/js/images on each request, so for deployment to production you will want to precompile your assets. If a file exists under public/assets it will be served by rails without invoking the asset pipeline and recompiling the file.

Generally, to compile the assets, rails comes with assets:precompile rake task.

@bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production@

Setting production environment is important here, and therefore the guideline is to run it on the production server. The result of precompilation is the public/assets folder populated with all your compiled .js and .css fiels with MD5 hash included to the name. If you use sass-rails asset helpers, the paths inside css will also be rewritten to point to the fingerprinted assets.

"Heroku now supports 3.1 asset compilation on their cedar stack":http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails31_heroku_cedar

Once the app is deployed, heroku will compile requested assets on their cache miss, and store it in the app's tmp directory automatically, solving the long stanging issue of hacking its read-only filesystem.

Oddly, it looks like precompiling assets has no effect on heroku (e.g. with @heroku run rake -t assets:precompile@), it sill recompiles them on the first request.

Once you app can compile and serve the assets, you can setup an Amazon CloudFront CDN distribution with your server as the origin server. Then include the distribution's domain name into 

@config.action_controller.asset_host = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net"@

With Jammit you had to jump through the hoops, rewrite asset paths to bust CDN caches, upload to S3. With the fingerprinted assets, you just push your app to production and CloudFront will cache the assets on its servers. This is a big win for me as it removes a somewhat lengthy process of uploading all assets to S3.

h2. Final cleanup

The final cleanup consists of removing jammit and/or jammit-s3 gems from Gemfile, @bundle install@ it, removing config/assets.yml, calls to include jammit packages from the layout markup.
